                <p>
                    I have spent my career learning what I need to know. My passion for technology started
                    early. In sixth grade I got a Tandy 64 for Christmas and started writing color basic out of a book
                    that
                    came with it. I started combining various projects and creating things. I knew then I wanted to be
                    a programmer. Life happens, and other opportunities were available, and I jumped on it. The last 20
                    years of my professional career have been working in IT and customer support. All of it has been
                    self-taught and early guidance on the job. Itâ€™s now time to follow my heart and move into software
                    development. The past year has been spent working during the day and coming home at night to study
                    programming.
